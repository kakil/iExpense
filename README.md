# iExpense

iExpense is an app that pushes SwiftUI skills beyond the basics.  
This app has multiple screens, loads and saves user data, and a more complex user interface. 
The app is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. 
This app is basically a form and a list.  
We explore how to present and dismiss a second screen of data, delete rows from a list, save and load user data, aand more.
